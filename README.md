### Gamepad Inputs in Pygame 🎮🕹️

This program displays a window layout that shows the inputs from an Xbox controller (🎮).

- **Pygame Version**: You can change the skin from black to white by pressing the respective keys on the keyboard: 'w' for white (default) and 'b' for black.
  - **Limitation**: When the Pygame window is not in focus, it will not update the inputs.
 
- **PyQt5**: You can switch the skin from black to white and back by pressing the icon on the top left corner.
  - **Pros**: It keeps updating even if it is not the main focused window.
  - **Cons**: It uses more resources from the machine, so it can display the inputs from Pygame in PyQt.

**Feel free to let me know how to solve that problem or if there's anything else you'd like to refine or add!**
