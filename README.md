## Gamepad Inputs in Pygame

This program displays a window layout that shows the inputs from an Xbox controller (ðŸŽ®). You can change the skin from black to white by pressing the respective keys on the keyboard: 'w' for white (default) and 'b' for black.

Limitation: When the Pygame window is not in focus, it will not update the inputs.

Feel free to let me know how to surpass that problem or if there's anything else you'd like to refine or add!
